# Insane Final Bot
Twitch bot for https://jpcmarques.github.io/IFBCompanion/ 

The bot allows you to run a series of commands allowing you to go for IFB and interact with your stream with a wide array of commands - and you don't need to sign up for the bot to work, just a pm will suffice!

All commands are case-insensitive.

## Management commands (owner/mod level)

### Adding/removing bot from your stream

- Joining: whisper the user **IFBCompanion** `!joinme`
- Leaving: whisper the user **IFBCompanion** `!leaveme`

**Arguments**:
